WindowsPhone app that keeps you up to date with the forest fire danger level in your area. Pin a live tile and stay in the know!



Overview
--------

[Fire Danger](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/firedanger/de47b14d-6e61-4ccb-949d-5daaa116beaf)
aims to keep you up to date with the fire danger level in your area by
displaying a visual representation on a live tile. From within the app, you
can also view forecast details including wind strength, relative humidity,
energy release component.



Data Source Disclaimer
----------------------

Data is pulled from the Wildland Fire Assesment System (wfas.net), which is
only updated once a day at 5pm MST. Not all regions are represented. Sometimes
regions go missing for a day or two. Many regions have obscure names (ranger
stations?). If there's demand, I can search for an alternative data source to
alleviate these issues.
